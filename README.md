## 🌐 How to Deploy (Free)

The easiest way to share this with your Valentine is to deploy it for free using **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended) & Netlify (Alternative)

1.  **Push to GitHub**:
    - Create a new repository on GitHub.
    - Run these commands in your project folder:
      ```bash
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      git branch -M main
      git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
      git push -u origin main
      ```

2.  **Connect to Vercel**:
    - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login.
    - Click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
    - Import your GitHub repository.
    - Click **"Deploy"**.
    - Vercel will give you a live link (e.g., `valentine-project.vercel.app`) to share!

### Option 2: Drag & Drop (Netlify Drop) - No Git required

1.  **Build the Project**:
    Run the build command to create a `dist` folder:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Deploy**:
    - Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
    - Drag and drop the `dist` folder (created in step 1) onto the page.
    - Netlify will instantly generate a link for you.
